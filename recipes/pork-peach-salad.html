        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>3 medium (blank)s fresh peaches - pitted, skinned, and sliced</li>
        <li>1 bunch kale, stems removed and discarded</li>
        <li>1 cup matchstick-cut carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, minced ginger, minced garlic, cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon
            salt,
            and white pepper in a pint-sized jar with a lid. Place the lid on the jar and shake the ingredients until
            well blended. Taste and adjust seasoning, if desired. Place container in the refrigerator until ready to
            use.</li>
        <li>Clean grates of an outdoor grill and preheat to medium-high, about 10 minutes, or as the manufacturer
            recommends.</li>
        <li>When grill is ready, grease grates using tongs to hold a paper towel saturated with vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>While the grill is heating, combine smoked paprika, granulated garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and black pepper
            in
            a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of pork slices with dry spice mixture and allow to stand at room temperature until the
            grill is ready.</li>
        <li>Place seasoned pork slices on the grill and do not touch for about 2 minutes. Using tongs, flip the slices
            and continue to grill until grill marks form and the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F
            (62 degrees C), an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the grill and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place peach slices across the grate and grill until grill marks form, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add to the
            reserved grilled pork slices.</li>
        <li>Make a bundle of kale leaves and slice across into 1/8-inch slices. Place sliced kale and carrots in a large
            mixing bowl. Add grilled pork slices and grilled peaches, and toss with desired amount of dressing (see
            note).</li>
        <li>Arrange salad on plates, and sprinkle 1/4 cup blueberries on each plate.</li>
